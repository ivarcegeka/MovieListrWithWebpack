# MovieListrWithWebpack
The same MovieListr application I made with JSPM, but this time with webpack.

Technologies used here:
- Angular 2
- Webpack
- Typescript

# To start the project run the following commands:
```
# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Install typings
npm run typings

# Start dev server on localhost:9000
npm run start:dev

# Make dev bundle (unminimized / uncompressed)
npm run bundle:dev

# Make prod bundle (minimized / compressed)
npm run bundle:prod

```
